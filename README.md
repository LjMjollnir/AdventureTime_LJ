# AdventureTime_LJ
an Updated version of Mikes AdventureTime for Idle Champions - EGS and Steam

## THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES Mikes latest memory functions files found at https://github.com/mikebaldi/Idle-Champions

## Installation
- Download Mikes script above and extract it to a folder someplace
- download Adventuretime_Lj.ahk from here and put it in the same folder as Mikes Script
- Install AHK if you dont already have it https://www.autohotkey.com/ (Current version works fine)
- Double click on Adventuretime_LJ.AHK


Basically the same AdventureTime.ahk thats been floating around for ages with a new GUI

### Leveler/Ults
Basic leveling script.. will level selected seats use ults and make sure the Q formation is loaded

### Jimothy
Used to get to silly high zones 2001 is max currenty and there is no ban wall anymore

- Make sure Briv, Hew and Jim are in the Q formation
- Remove Briv from the E formation

- Use the E Formation zones Tab in the script based on your Briv Skips
- Select your Skip number and if it is 100% or not and the script will auto select which zones to use the E Formation
- you can then add additional zones to use E

Once you believe you are setup correctly press the Jimothy button to get started

### Basic requirements
- Jimothy obviously - This guy turns non boss enemies into Chickens
- Briv - You use Briv to Skip over Boss zones since you cant turn them into Chickens
- Hew Maan - These little kobolds make it so when you kill and enemy you get more quest progress

### Useful Champs
- Widdle - with some other champions that reduce Attack cooldown you can have Jim down to 0.98s attack speed
- Havilar - If your Hew Maan is not geared enough to make it 1 kill to progress Havi with Red Imp doubles Progress for Chicken kills as they are classified as Fiends
- Sentry - Can bring quest requirement down to 17 but unreliable in the high zones
- Ulkoria - If for some reason you dont have Widdle, with alot of casters there is a chance to reset Jims attack

#### Notes
- Can use the Leveler to level and use ultimate attacks
- Stops the Script if Briv goes below a number of Haste Stacks. Safety feature so your formation doesnt continue into a boss
- Easier selection for what zones to use the E formations for. This is updated even while the script is running, so if you realise you need to skip certain zones because of armoured enemies or ranged units you can now fix that while the script is running
- ***Disable your Modron Reset*** Modron is quite happy to waste all your good potions and the script will also report an error when jumping back to z1

### Azaka
- This is used to time Omin contracts with Azaka Ult
- **YOU** need to find your Omin contracts memory address each time
- dont ask me.. ive never used this feature im sure someone in #scripting can help you
